# BUILD_ID is usually used to specify the branch name
# (like "MAIN") or a branch name and a release candidate
# (like "CRB01").  It must be a single word, and is
# capitalized by convention.

# MS = minimal-systems
# xx.xx.xx = major release date
# Px = patch version level
# dev = development build_id
